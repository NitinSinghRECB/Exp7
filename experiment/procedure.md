## Experimental Procedure
### Specimen Preparation
Prepare a flat ceramic sample and polish the surface sequentially using finer abrasives followed by diamond paste polishing to obtain a mirror-like finish.

### Indentation Loading
Apply a controlled indentation load P ≈ 10 N with a dwell time of ~10 s.

### Indent Selection
Produce multiple indents at well-spaced locations and select only those impressions showing clear radial cracks.

### Crack Measurement
Measure crack length c from the center of the indent to each crack tip and calculate the average.

### Property Inputs
Obtain E and H from indentation measurements or literature.

### Fracture Toughness Calculation
Substitute values into the Anstis equation.

### Repeatability Check
Perform at least 5–10 indentations and report mean K<sub>IC</sub> with standard deviation.

## Implications
The indentation crack length method provides a rapid and resource-efficient means of estimating fracture toughness when conventional fracture tests are impractical. It requires only small samples and standard hardness equipment, making it particularly useful for thin films, coatings, miniature components, and newly developed ceramics.

## Limitations
The method provides approximate toughness values because it relies on semi-empirical constants and assumes ideal median crack geometries and homogeneous materials. Small measurement errors in crack length c significantly affect results due to the c<sup>3/2</sup> dependence.
